## About the Regents

At the economic hub of the United States, there exists an exam that all highschoolers will inevitably take in their life. What I am talking about is the Regents Exam, not the SHSAT (I don't live in NYC). The Regents exam consists of a couple of Math, Science, World Language, English, and History exams, completed in 3 hours with around 35 questions. This is supposed to be pretty easy, however, the percent of people who score a Level 5 (85+) in the easiest math regents (Algebra I) is a staggering 15%. At the exam, everyone is a little nervous. It's a hot June day, everyone is friends with each other, and summer break is right around the corner. Then, as the regents results come on the report card, people are always disappointed. "I thought I would do good!, I studied all night." The regents isn't too hard of an exam and anyone can get a high score. We want to unleash that capability. 

## Our journey

At StudyR, we believe that anyone can be successful in the regents exams. The biggest problem we find with students studying for the Regents is the lack of resources. All students can really do is go over notes again, wait for their teacher to assign them a new packet, or take a bunch of previous exams. Imagine how boring that is. It is understandable that nobody wanted to study for the regents, its too much hard work to set up these resources in a helpful manner and you would ideally want to use that hard work to actually study for the regents. It has gotten so bad that even the AP exams and SAT are actually easier to studyr. With the new clusters for science regents, everyone was scrambling because this new change led to a lot of their resources being redundant. We want to be the one stop shop for actual regents prep, for 100% free, forever.
